Always set the example to answer every incoming call on the first ring.
Supported the success of the #1 Salesperson in 2016 for Southwest Region and USA, achieving 140% AOP, with positive sales growth in all assigned product categories.  Personally assigned by the Customer Service Manager to create and manage the Hydraulic growth programs and initial stock orders for Tompkins, covering multiple locations and over $1M in first year sales, while maintaining discretion and confidentiality prior to public corporate and industry announcements.  Partnered for "meet and greet" personal introductions to Tompkins account leadership, sales, and support personnel to establish and maintain open and genuine rapport.   Recommended reducing incoming call notification time from 30 seconds to 15 seconds, allowing other representatives a second chance to answer and respond, resulting in 98% answer and 15.8 seconds average response time for 2016.  Selected for the second Merivis Foundation Cohort to receive formal Salesforce training and mentoring.  Completed over Salesforce 50 training modules in less than one year.  Trained three new associates in order management, and how to find and suggest alternative solutions to save orders that may otherwise deliver late or cancel.
